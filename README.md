# Minimax-Checkers
Created as an SE 101 Final Project, intended to work hand in hand with an Arduino, proving a you with a virtual checkers opponent. 


This project makes use of a minimax algorithm in order to choose the best move for the computer to make when playing against you. Code is 
written in c++ in order to work along side an arduino, which displays the current board state on an LED Matrix and takes player input 
with buttons. This project is a self contained checkers game, including pvp and pve functionalities, the minimax rests on top of a strong
framework of rules optimized for its preformance.
